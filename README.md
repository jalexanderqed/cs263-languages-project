Jack Alexander (jalexanderqed)
Sierra Schwellenbach (sierrasch)

Sierra is the superior coder clearly as she has finished the pi calculations for go while Jack has, and I quote "attempted to buy a couch". As such, Sierra will maintain the title of supreme coding champion and shall now be allowed to order Jack around for all eternity both in coding and in League. All hail Sierra
