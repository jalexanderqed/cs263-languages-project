Jack Alexander (jalexanderqed)
Sierra Schwellenbach (sierrasch)

Week 1:

Sierra is the superior coder clearly as she has finished the pi calculations for go while Jack has, and I quote "attempted to buy a couch". As such, Sierra will maintain the title of supreme coding champion and shall now be allowed to order Jack around for all eternity both in coding and in League. All hail Sierra

Aha! Another program started and conquered!! I am the master of go and python and before long I will surely conquer the java domain too! I possess inifinite wisdom and cleverness and will proceed to take over the world with them if unhindered. I will soon expand my slow takeover of the world with such functions as graph traversals, matrix multiplies, and prime number calculations. Jack will only be able to attempt to keep up with my intellect but doubtlessly fall short as many before him have done. But I do not blame him, of course. There have been very few able to even follow my train of thought let alone rival it. Mere mortals needn't be concerned with their own ineptitude as it is not so much their own short-coming as my own unparalleled ability. Tune in next time as I tackle some of the other major challenges of our time. 


Week 2:

New challenges have come about this week. Namely, as we sat down to learn of the intricacies of AWS Lambda, my flatmate had the lack of foresight to mention to me that there was a new Harry Potter mobile game out. I was therefore thrust into the magical world of Hogwarts unceremoniously and had a lot of trouble focusing on lambda functions from then on. Fortunately, Jack was unswayed by the call of the magical world and diligently set up our Maven project for making AWS Lambda calls. By some magical happenstance we managed to accomplish our goals for the weak of learning about AWS Lambda and beginning to get it set-up. Nevertheless, I am loath to admit that the true MVP of the week would probably be Jack. On the coattails of my brilliant success last week, I will accept this secondary role. Next week, I will reclaim the heights of my successes in week 1 by somehow exercising some monolithic strength to ignore the callings of Harry Potter mobile games.

Week 3:

Alas,it seems I forgot to update the README last week. Fear not, I will provide my executive summary now. In fact it is not alltogether suprising that updating the README did not make the list of tasks for the week as our main focus was getting Lambda to work. This, as it turns out, is quite the undertaking. It involved several hours of messing with permissions groups, formatting functions to arbitrary specifications, and other such finagling. I was also forced to update half the software on my computer as it turned out the version requirments for various things were far later than what I had installed. Nonetheless, we finally triumphantly got Lambda working in each of our chosen languages (Python, Go, and Java) completing the most irritating and frustrating part of our project thus far. Henceforth, most of our work shall consist of writing various benchmark functions for lambda into this new framework and performing the tests themselves. Onward and upward!

Week 4:

Things are going well in the Lambda world. Jack has spent the week working on deserialization for the JSON we recieve from the Lamda function. I have been working on writing more test functions (specifically an nth prime function). This week has been a bit tricky as both of us were out of town on our normal thurday/friday worktimes. As such, we chose to attack the problem from two separate angles. I am happy to report that much of this project is coming together at this point. We shall see how the coming weeks go but I am confident that we will achieve both of our goals: benchmarking lambda in different languages and learning about lambda. Until then, I bid you adoo.
