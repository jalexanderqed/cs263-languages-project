Jack Alexander (jalexanderqed)
Sierra Schwellenbach (sierrasch)

Sierra is the superior coder clearly as she has finished the pi calculations for go while Jack has, and I quote "attempted to buy a couch". As such, Sierra will maintain the title of supreme coding champion and shall now be allowed to order Jack around for all eternity both in coding and in League. All hail Sierra

Aha! Another program started and conquered!! I am the master of go and python and before long I will surely conquer the java domain too! I possess inifinite wisdom and cleverness and will proceed to take over the world with them if unhindered. I will soon expand my slow takeover of the world with such functions as graph traversals, matrix multiplies, and prime number calculations. Jack will only be able to attempt to keep up with my intellect but doubtlessly fall short as many before him have done. But I do not blame him, of course. There have been very few able to even follow my train of thought let alone rival it. Mere mortals needn't be concerned with their own ineptitude as it is not so much their own short-coming as my own unparalleled ability. Tune in next time as I tackle some of the other major challenges of our time.
